Infrastructure costs grow faster than generated revenue, thereby destroying the business model. Here are three concrete examples of massive savings.","sections":[{"title":"GCP: Save €25k/year or 55% with 10 lines of code","text":"In a Google Cloud project, inefficient programming logic forgot to cache failed database queries, allowing millions of read accesses to always pass through to the database and causing immense costs. Only 10 lines of code for temporary storage (= caching) helped solve this problem and reduced database costs by 55% per month or €25k per year.","image":"/case_studies/gcp_datastore_optimization.png"},{"title":"GCP: Save €75k/year with Serverless Architecture","text":"A customer software used classic cloud instances (virtual machines) to run its application. These ran 24/7 and were designed for peak loads. By switching to serverless approaches, costs adapt to the actual network traffic of your application – meaning low traffic = lower costs! By automatically scaling to zero during inactivity, even more costs can be saved.

Too often, all log data from an application is simply collected indiscriminately and stored in a so-called Log Analytics Workspace from Azure. Here, the configuration was not adapted to the actual needs of the business. A 3-minute reconfiguration of the existing Azure cloud resources resulted in savings of approximately €4k per month.","image":"/case_studies/azure_log_analytics_optimization.png"}]}},{"slug":"zero-ops","title":"SaaS Model as Revenue Multiplier","category":"Consulting & Development","description":"Modernization of a 10-year-old application enabled serving 10x more customers with the same team size.","results":["10x more customers","Maintenance-free infrastructure","3x higher team velocity"],"logos":["/google_cloud_platform_logo.png"],"content":{"title":"SaaS model as revenue multiplier","intro":"Intelligent architecture allows any software to scale arbitrarily and fully automatically, incurring costs only when your customers actually use it.

Furthermore, an operations team was intentionally omitted, creating a sustainable and maintenance-free ZeroOps infrastructure using a cloud-first strategy.","sections":[{"title":"The Challenge","text":"A customer's software (C# + SQL Server) was operated for 10 years without major modernization. The existing development team reached its capacity limits, and it was not possible to add more customers without losing quality and reliability. Maintenance and care proved to be a challenge and caused high costs. The business model could no longer grow, and the company was at the end of its growth."},{"title":"Solution: SaaS Model with Google Cloud Platform","text":"The SaaS model describes the characteristic of serving many customers simultaneously with a shared infrastructure and software. For this purpose, the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was chosen, as it particularly supports the serverless approach. Through the clever selection of managed services (Cloud Run, BigQuery, Dataflow), operational tasks could be skillfully outsourced to GCP, and the development team focused on new development.","points":["Automated scaling to zero during inactivity","Managed Security & Managed Services (Cloud Run, BigQuery, Dataflow)","Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with Terraform for customer environments"]},{"title":"ZeroOps: Operating Costs = 0","text":"A good infrastructure repairs itself (self-healing) and scales automatically with actual usage (also Cloud-Native Architecture).
